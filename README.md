### 🧠 About Me

Hi, I'm Alex! I am a very ambitious engineer driven to innovate and create things that initially seem impossible. I am beyond fascinated by AI due to its complexity and potential to challenge the way we think about intelligence, forcing us into an unprecedented world. Alongside this, I am very curious about exploring the abstract world of mathematics, and how this language of the universe shapes our reality.

I strive to become a high-level Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher, guided by extreme discipline. My goal is simple: to be the best at what I do. 

### 🚀 Research & Current Work

I am currently exploring complex topics in **AI, Reasoning, and Multi-Agent Systems**.

* **Role Evolution in Multi-Agent Systems:** Engineering a novel architecture with dynamically evolving agents. This involves agents that adapt strategies and switch roles based on performance and environmental demands to maximize efficiency.
* **Neuro-Symbolic Theorem Prover:** Combining the chain-of-thought reasoning of LLMs with the symbolic rigor of proof-assistants like Lean to enhance logical consistency in AI outputs.

### 🎓 Education

* **Florida International University**
    * *M.S. in Artificial Intelligence* (Expected 2027)
    * *B.S. in Computer Science* (Expected 2026)
