# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alex!

### ðŸ§  About Me
I love to innovate and create new things that initially seem impossible. I am beyond fascinated by AI due to its complexity and potential, challenging the way we think about intelligence and forcing us into an unprecedented world. 

Every day, I strive to become the best engineer and researcher I can be, guided by being as disciplined as I can be.

* **Metacognition in Multi-Agent Systems:** Engineering a novel architecture with dynamically evolving agents.
* **Neuro-Symbolic Theorem Prover:** Combining the chain-of-thought reasoning of LLMs with the symbolic rigor of proof-assistants like Lean.
