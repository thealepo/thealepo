# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alex!

### About Me
I love to innovate and create new things that initially seem impossible. I am beyond fascinated by AI due to its complexity and potential, challenging the way we think about intelligence and forcing us into an unprecedented world. Every day, I strive to become the best engineer and researcher I can be, guided by being as disciplined as I can be.

### Current Projects
- Exploring **metacognition in multi-agent systems**, aiming to engineer a novel architecture with evolving agents.
- Developing a **neuro-symbolic automated theorem prover**, combining the chain-of-thought reasoning of LLMs alongside the symbolic rigor of proof-assistants like Lean.
