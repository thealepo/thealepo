# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex!

## About Me
I'm an Undergraduate at Florida International University studying Computer Science & Mathematics, while concurrently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence.
My passion lies in building AI systems that matter. I love working on projects that combine theoretical insight with engineering. I believe that at the cross of engineering and research, we can find the greatest leaps of innovation.
When I'm not coding, you can find me doing Calisthenics or playing Chess. 🤓
